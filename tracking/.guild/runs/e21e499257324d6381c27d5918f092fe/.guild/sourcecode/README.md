## Structure and use of the code

### Basic structure
  - *data* 
  - *models* 
  - *notebooks* - used only for analysis, graphs etc.
  - *src* - main reusable code used to run experiments and sometimes as libraries in notebooks

### Reproducibility

The experiments were organized and tracked using [guild.ai](https://my.guild.ai/) so it is easier to used to view/re-run experiments
or generate new ones.

**Very basic operations to review runs**
- View experiments runs in browser ``guild view`` 
- View experiments runs in the console ``guild compare``
