## Structure and use of the code

### Basic structure
  - *data* - used data, officially provided and external data
  - *models* - to place some models (e.g., for ensembling ) generated outside of runs (e.g., in notebooks)
  - *notebooks* - used for analysis, graphs etc., and in some cases to train light models (e.g., RF)
  - *src* - main reusable code used to run experiments 

### Reproducibility

The experiments were organized and tracked using [guild.ai](https://my.guild.ai/).

**Very basic operations to review runs**
- View experiments runs in browser ``guild view`` 
- View experiments runs in the console ``guild compare``
